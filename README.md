# RLHF for Diffusion Models

This is an implementation of [Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13301). This is meant as an educational codebase, with lots of comments explaining the code 
and only basic features. It currently only implements [LAION aesthetic classifier](https://github.com/LAION-AI/aesthetic-predictor) as a reward function, but more examples will be added soon.

*Tutorial blog post coming soon*

_This codebase is just for educational purposes, another codebase for scalable training coming soon through CarperAI_

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/tmabraham/ddpo-pytorch.git
cd ddpo-pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

It's as simple as running:
```
python main.py
```

To save memory (you'll likely need it), use the arguments `--enable_attention_slicing`, `--enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention`, and `--enable_grad_checkpointing`.
